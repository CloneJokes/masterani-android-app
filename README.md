# Masterani
A basic android app to watch anime.
This one goes to my bookmarks as a homepage.
## Credits
This project was made to enjoy [Masterani.me](https://www.masterani.me) through an android app. That said, all credits belong to masterani.me as all information in the app is from them.
  
Only thing I've done is create a simple app that loads the webpages into a webviewer.

## TODO
This is a work in progress, and this release only contains the most basic of features. Some **future possible implementations** include:
* Turning the phone orientation should not resets the app
* Various Android versions support
* Optimizations and Memory Management Improvements
* Check if no internet
* Fix the ad issues

## About
I made this app because I wanted to watch anime on my phone through the convenience of an app.

###### Criticism is greatly appreciated, as this is my first android studio application, so many things still need to be fixed.
